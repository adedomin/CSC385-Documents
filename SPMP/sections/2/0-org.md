2. Project Organization
=======================

The e-Bank system shall be built and designed closely following the agile methodology.
Agile practices encourage faster development processes that focus more on solving user stories and coping with rapid changed.
This is in contrast with other software engineering models, which make overreaching plans that will either be completely ignored or undergo heavy revisions.
Changes are inevitable are too time consuming and costly to deal with in an application that must be developed in a short time window.

The organization of the e-Bank will be through an online system in which all developers can communicate effectively if or when all developers cannot meet in person.
Even though meeting in person is best, understanding time conflicting it is the best way to stay in contact while effectively finishing each phase of the design.
The organization of the interface will be constructed through the boundaries of a simple page layout, strategical colors and textures, use data fields appropriately, icons, messages boxes etc...in an interactive way with the user allowing easy access to online banking.
