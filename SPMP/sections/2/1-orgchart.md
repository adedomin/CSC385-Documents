2.1 Organization

In keeping with agile workflows and organization, all developers are expected to also play a role in managing the project, but more importantly, themselves.

It is also expected that developers pick the work that best fits their knowledge or skill.
There is no reason that developers have to fixed into any particular role, such as front end development, database design, etc.
