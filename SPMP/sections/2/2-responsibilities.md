2.2. Project Responsibilities
----------------------------

All team members are to come up with features, tasks, or other implementable ideas to the project manager.
The project manager must also come up with the above.
The project manager should also meet with the customer to determine the full needs and ability of the application.

Once The above is completed, it is expected that the project manager and the other team members come up with *user stories* which correspond to the gathered information.
The user stories shall be compiled by the project manager into tasks.
Tasks shall include the following:

  * Name of the developer who shall complete the feature (or unassigned)
  * A descriptive title
  * A user story which describes what the feature implements or solves
  * Criteria that defines when the feature is considered correct and complete.
  * Estimated time to complete
  * The deadline for the feature

The tasks shall be recorded onto a Kanban board.
The Kanban board is merely a board which is broken into the following sections.

  * Backlog, work that is unassigned and to be done later.
  * Ready, The feature is ready to be worked on.
  * In progress, the feature is being worked on.
  * Done, the feature meets acceptance criteria.

Developers should be expected to take on work voluntarily or solve the work as handed out by the project manager.
However, a user story can not be considered *done* until the project manager signs off on it.
