3. Managerial Process
=====================

3.1. Objectives and Priorities
-------------------------------

The management objective of this project is to produce a working e-banking system on time with all of the functionality described in the SRS, while maintaining the schedule outlined in 3.1.2.  This will be accomplished by keeping everyone up on the same page through emails, change logs, and weekly meetings.

3.2. Assumptions, Dependencies, and Constraints 
------------------------------------------------

The completion of this project is dependent on the participation of all 4 group members completing their work in a timely fashion, and that the deadlines of March 30, 2016 (Design documents), April 27,2016 (Final Deliverable), and April 29, May 2, and May 4, (Project Presentation) do not change.  

3.3. Risk Management
--------------------

Potential risk factors for the success of the project include group members not completing work on time, potentially hindering the work of other group members, due to illness, familial emergency, or not having the time to finish.
Miscommunication between group members on changing requirements due to unforeseen problems arising.
Our contingency for these risks rely on the trust we have for each group member to bring it to the attention of everyone if they are encountering problems.
This will be facilitated by frequent communication between group members, and frequent deadlines to ensure we never fall too far behind.

3.4. Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms 
------------------------------------------

The monitoring of progress will be done through weekly meetings (typically Monday/Wednesday at 11:00am - 2:00pm) on the second floor of the library.
These meetings will allow us to inform the other members of our progress on various tasks and address any questions or concerns we may have.
Frequent emails will also be exchanged allowing us to contribute the work that has been completed to be compiled for final use.
Use of the online task board, kanban board, will also allow us to view how members are progressing on the subsections of their tasks.  

3.5. Technical Process
----------------------

### 3.5.1. Methods, Tools, and Techniques

The methods, tools, and techniques used during the course of the project are listed in the SRS.

### 3.5.2. Software Documentation

Documentation will be done by everyone, and will be done through kanban boards which will allow us to see documentation for each change to the work that we make. This documentation will be reviewed to make sure that it is coherent and the intentions of the group are made clear.

3.6. Work Packages, Schedule, and Budget
----------------------------------------

### 3.6.1. Work Packages

Work is to be assigned through a kanban board, where developers will be able to choose what they wish to work on from the backlog.

### 3.6.2 Dependencies

The dependencies of the project are shown in section 3.1.2 in the form of a Water Fall Module.

### 3.6.3 Resource Requirements

The most obvious and important resource to the success of our project is the time of our group members.
At this time it is difficult to quantify the amount of time it will take each section of the project to complete due to a dearth of knowledge regarding the amount of previous experience that each of the group members has.
Other resources include a server on which to host the service, as well as the use of various programming languages and text editors.  

### 3.6.4 Budget and Resource Allocation

We don't have a budget for this project.
The allocation of group member time is currently unknown as the group has not defined it's agility as of yet.

### 3.6.5 Schedule

As of now, no Epics (collection of user stories) have been defined.
Thus, it is assumed complete value will be attained nearing the end of the project.
Expect changes to this section when epics are defined.
