1. Introduction
===============

e-Bank makes it easy for users to bank online without the hassle of physically going to a bank.
The basic functionalities, such as login/logout, view account, transfer funds, pay bills, utility, and security will be implemented in order for customers to use online.
The plan for development is to use the water fall module in order to complete each phase of this design.
The scheduled updates will be provided on a monthly bases and the unscheduled can be planned weekly in order to ensure new securities are up to date.
Below you will find a basic list of the project delivery.

1.1. Project Overview
---------------------

The e-Bank objectives for the design are to complete a database driven website that is functional for online users to complete successful banking transactions.
In the e-Bank the database will be holding userâ€™s information and while securing it when the user is no longer logged on.
The major activities for the e-Bank are to design a front-end and back- end website.
The front-end will consist of the user interface while the back-end will provide as the database in which it holds the users information.
The milestones in this project are the design requirements, project plan, system architecture design, Object-Ordinated design, the database design (back-end), and the user interface design (front-end).
This project when compared to other online banking systems will provide the user with a more user friendly (interactive) website design allowing the customers to access their banking information in an organized manner.
