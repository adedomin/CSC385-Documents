2. Definitions
==============

The following definitions may be strewn across the document.

  * 2.1. DAO: Data Access Object. An object pattern that abstracts database calls so that other databases could be used without changing other code.
  * 2.2. MVC: Model View Control, Design pattern that allows for object abstraction
  * 2.3. Node.js: Javascript for backend servers.
  * 2.4. express.js: a Node.js framework to simplify the creation of HTTP driven web applications.
  * 2.5. MongoDB: A NoSQL database that is highly scalable and performant.
  * 2.6. LevelDB: A basic, embedded key:value, database that is entirely implemented in Javascript
  * 2.7. Redis: A client - server key:value database that is distrubatble.
  * 2.8. Factory: pattern that defines objects that return new objects. Likely setting some default parameters.
  * 2.9. middleware: Business logic that is broken into discrete steps. Such as login, getting data and otherwise.
  * 2.10. controllers: Business logic to handle changes to underlying models; in the context of the application, middleware and controllers are very similar.
  * 2.11. Dependency Injection: Requires client objects to find their needed object dependencies.
