3.4. Project Organization
-------------------------

The e-Bank system design will undergo the waterfall model due to the design process having the identified phases which are requirements, system and software design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing, and lastly operation and maintenance.
Even though the waterfall model is difficult to accommodate changes the e-Bank should have no problem completing each phase in the appropriate time in order to move to the next phase.
The organization of the e-Bank will be through an online system in which all developers can communicate effectively if or when all developers cannot meet in person.
Even though meeting in person is best, understanding time conflicting it is the best way to stay in contact while effectively finishing each phase of the design.
The organization of the interface will be constructed through the boundaries of a simple page layout, strategical colors and textures, use data fields appropriately, icons, messages boxes etc...in an interactive way with the user allowing easy access to online banking.
