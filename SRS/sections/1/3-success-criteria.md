1.3. Objective and Success Criteria of the Project
------------------------------------------------

e-Bank makes it easy for users to bank online without the hassle of physically going to a bank.
Although e-Bank is easier to use, customers must know that if someone gets a hold of their username, passwords, or both could compromise their banking information.
Therefore, extra firewalls, security questions, and personal information will be ensured for this system to not allow any unauthorized users to compromise any customer information.

e-Bank will be web-based, so users will be able to collaborate without being in the same physical location.
It will provide a simple interface that will function across platforms and will be understandable by all e-Bank users.
Whenever possible, its features will remain flexible, so management of a project may be configured by users to meet the team’s specific needs.
A large section of e-Bank’s flexibility will be the availability for users to make the necessary banking transaction needed and the system’s transactions can be used into subgroups in order to help pay bills or even keep track of spending money.
This will allow users to keep organized in their daily financial tasks.
