1.1. Purpose of the System
---------------------------

The Purpose of e-bank is to help customers make banking easily available when a customer needs to access their funds. 
Some of the problems e-Bank faces:

  * Customer(s)
	* Validation of the customer’s username and password and ensuring security to discourage those who seek other customer’s information.
	* Transfer funds from the customer’s account to another person’s account. Valid banking information must be provided or the funds will not transfer.
  * End-User(s)
	* Valid information for transferring funds to an outside source will allow the end user to accept the funds coming in.
	* Transaction occurs the bank takes out too little or too much by mistake will cause customer accounts to be off.
  * Developer(s)
	* Too small of a database.
	* Creating a database that is successfully at authorizing usernames and passwords to each customer.
	* Database overload causes the system to go offline.
  * Concept statement- To overcome these problems it is the developers job to ensure that the proper sized database, the validations to username/passwords, the transactions are made to the design standard as well as the customer’s standards. This will be done so by with each section of the design system being made proper checks are done then showed to the customer.
