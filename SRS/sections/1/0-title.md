1. Introduction
================

The e-bank System is a database driven website designed to support online banking operations using the basic functionalities, such as login/logout, view account, transfer funds, pay bills, utility, and security.
The system design is developed through a series of processes to ensure all customersâ€™ needs are meet when banking online.
More specifically, customers who have the online banking account should be able to login the system by entering a valid username and password.
If the username and password is valid the customer can view their account.
View account allows a customer to see up to date balance information on deposit (saving/checking), credit card, debit cards and any other bank information.
The account also allows customers to view their transaction history up to a maximum of 180 days.
Transfer funds allows customer to transfer funds between authorized personal accounts.
Requested transfer takes place immediately or at a selected future date specified by customer.
Customers are allowed to view and/or terminate pending transfers.
The customer can use online pay bill service to pay bills by debiting their account.
This payment is made to payee corporations that the customer has registered with online banking by using the registered bills.
With new payee corporations that the customer has not registered, this payment can be made immediately or at a later date.
Utility allows customer to change password, secure delivery contact information, and choose the types of security questions.
This allows the customers who forget their password be able to reset it through their email but to also ensure it through a secure system.
Customers can also change the online profile and personal information.
When the customer is done using e-bank they can simply logoff.
If the customer stays on for 20 minutes while the site is unused then the system will automatically log the customer off due to security reasons.
